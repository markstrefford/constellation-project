## 5. Cognitive Audit

### 🪐 JUPITER
- **[Tick 965]** `nan`: _Given that we are a primary producer of fuel_raw, setting a fixed price of $0.02 ensures stability and predictability for traders while maximizing our production output. Food and fuel_refined require dynamic pricing to attract necessary trade volume due to their consumption needs._
- **[Tick 980]** `nan`: _Given that I am a primary producer of fuel_raw and have minimal consumption, 'fixed' pricing is ideal for maintaining stable low prices. However, food and refined fuel are critical assets with high demand, so dynamic pricing will help ensure adequate supply through trader activity._
- **[Tick 995]** `nan`: _Set 'fuel_raw' to a fixed price of $0.02 to ensure consistent production and low prices for the market. Use dynamic pricing for 'food' and 'fuel_refined' to attract traders based on current demand and supply conditions. Maintain normal refinery priority to balance refined fuel production with raw material sales._

### 🪐 CERES
- **[Tick 955]** `nan`: _Given the critical stock levels of fuel_refined and minimal trading activity, I am using dynamic pricing for fuel_refined to attract traders. Fixed pricing is set for food as it's a surplus item. Aggressive refinery priority ensures maximum production of refined fuel._
- **[Tick 975]** `nan`: _Set dynamic pricing for fuel_refined to attract traders due to critical stock levels. Fixed price for food as it is in surplus. Aggressive refinery priority to maximize refined fuel production._
- **[Tick 995]** `nan`: _Given the critical state of fuel_refined, I am setting a premium pricing strategy to attract traders immediately. Food production exceeds consumption, so fixed prices can be maintained for high profit margins. The refinery is set to aggressive mode to maximize refined fuel output._

### 🪐 EARTH
- **[Tick 980]** `nan`: _Given the critical stock level of fuel_refined, dynamic pricing is essential to attract traders and prevent a stockout. Food production exceeds consumption, allowing for fixed pricing to maximize profit margins._
- **[Tick 985]** `nan`: _Given the critical shortage of fuel_refined and healthy stock of food, dynamic pricing with an emergency strategy for fuel_refined is necessary to attract traders immediately. Fixed pricing at current market rate for food allows us to maintain profit while ensuring survival through aggressive refinery operations._
- **[Tick 990]** `nan`: _Set 'dynamic' pricing for fuel_refined to attract traders and ensure survival. Fixed pricing is used for food, as it's not critical but can generate profit. Aggressive refinery priority due to low stock of refined fuel._

### 🪐 MARS
- **[Tick 960]** `nan`: _The hub is currently in a critical state with fuel_refined stock running low. Dynamic pricing will adapt to market conditions for food and emergency pricing will prioritize refueling over profit margins. The refinery must operate aggressively to maximize refined fuel production from any incoming raw fuel deliveries._
- **[Tick 970]** `nan`: _The hub is facing a critical fuel_refined shortage, requiring aggressive refinery operations to maximize production. Both food and fuel_refined are prioritized as critical assets due to the imminent risk of stockouts. Dynamic pricing will be used for both food and fuel_refined to ensure sufficient supply while attracting traders. An emergency pricing strategy is applied to fuel_refined to prioritize its availability over profit._
- **[Tick 980]** `nan`: _Employ 'discount' pricing for fuel_refined to attract more traders, balancing consumption needs. Keep food and other critical assets on dynamic pricing to adapt stock levels. Aggressively refine raw fuel due to low stock of refined fuel._
